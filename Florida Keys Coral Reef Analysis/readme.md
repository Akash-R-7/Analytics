# 🐠 Florida Keys Coral Reef Analysis
---
### 📌 Project Overview

This project explores long-term coral reef trends in the **Florida Keys** using datasets from **Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP)** and **air quality sensors**. The goal is to analyze coral density, health, and environmental conditions—supporting **scientists, policymakers**, and **citizens** in designing **data-driven conservation strategies**.

---

### 🎯 Goals

* Analyze **temporal and spatial trends** in coral ecosystems (density, cover, colonies).
* Evaluate **Sanctuary-wide changes** using key performance indicators.
* Study **species composition** across diverse reef habitats and monitoring sites.

### 📂 Project Sections

1️⃣ **Coral Overview** – Visualizes trends in hard (stony) and soft (octocoral) coral: density, % cover, and colony count.  
2️⃣ **Stony Coral** – Tracks stony coral health metrics (e.g., tissue area, disease spread) and water temperature changes.  
3️⃣ **Species** – Displays species distribution across reef habitats and monitoring stations.
