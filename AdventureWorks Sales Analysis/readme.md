# AdventureWorks Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
AdventureWorks, a global sports equipment retailer (fictional), employs **sales representatives** who report to **sales managers** based on territories. The **VP of Sales** wants an interactive dashboard to track sales performance across employees, regions, and products [(Dataset)](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks2022.bak).

## 🎯 Goals
- Identify **top-performing salespeople** based on total sales.
- Analyze **each individual's sales** by comparing performance across years.
- Calculate **Year-to-Date (YTD) sales** for each salesperson and compare with the same period last year.
- Determine **top-selling products per salesperson**.
- Track **high-performing sales regions and resellers**.
- Implement **role-based filtering** so salespeople can view their own data, managers can see their and their subordinates' data, while the VP can access all sales data.
